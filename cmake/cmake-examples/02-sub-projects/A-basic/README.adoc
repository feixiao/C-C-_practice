# Introduction

This example shows how to setup a CMake project that includes sub-projects. The
top level CMakeLists.txt calls the CMakeLists.txt in the sub directories to
create the following:

  * sublibrary1 - A static library
  * sublibrary2 - A header only library
  * subbinary - An executable

The files included in this example are:

```
$ tree
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── subbinary
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main.cpp
├── sublibrary1
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   ├── inc
│   │   └── sublib1.h
│   └── src
│       └── sublib1.cpp
└── sublibrary2
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── inc
        └── sublib2.h
```

  * link:CMakeLists.txt[] - Top level CMakeLists.txt
  * link:subbinary/CMakeLists.txt[] - to make the executable
  * link:subbinary/main.cpp[] - source for the executable
  * link:sublibrary1/CMakeLists.txt[] - to make a static library
  * link:sublibrary1/inc/sublib1.h[]
  * link:sublibrary1/src/sublib2.cpp[]
  * link:sublibrary2/CMakeLists.txt[] - to setup header only library
  * link:sublibrary2/inc/sublib2.h[]

# Concepts

## Adding a Sub-Directory

A CMakeLists.txt file can include and call sub-directories which include a CMakeLists.txt
files.

[source,cmake]
----
add_subdirectory(sublibrary1)
add_subdirectory(sublibrary2)
add_subdirectory(subbinary)
----

## Referencing Sub-Project Directories

When a project is created using the `project()` command, CMake will automatically
create a number of variables which can be used to reference details about the project.
These variables can then be used by other sub-projects or the main project. For exampe,
to include header files between projects.

[source,cmake]
----
include_directories(
    ${sublibrary1_SOURCE_DIR}/inc
    ${sublibrary2_SOURCE_DIR}/inc
    )
----

The variables created by CMake include:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Variable |Info
|PROJECT_NAME | The name of the project set by the current `project()`.

|CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME |the name of the first project set by the `project()`
command, i.e. the top level project.

|PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR |The source director of the current project.

|PROJECT_BINARY_DIR |The build directory for the current project.

|name_SOURCE_DIR | The source directory of the project called "name".
In this example the source directories created would be `sublibrary1_SOURCE_DIR`,
`sublibrary2_SOURCE_DIR`, and `subbinary_SOURCE_DIR`

|name_BINARY_DIR | The binary directory of the project called "name".
In this example the binary directories created would be `sublibrary1_BINARY_DIR`,
`sublibrary2_BINARY_DIR`, and `subbinary_BINARY_DIR`

|=======================================================================


## Referencing Libraries from Sub-Projects

If a sub-project creates a library, it can be referenced by other projects by
calling the name of the project in the `target_link_libraries()` command. This
means that you don't have to reference the full path of the new library and it
is added as a dependency.

[source,cmake]
----
target_link_libraries(subbinary
    sublibrary1
)
----

# Building the example

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir build

$ cd build/

$ cmake ..
